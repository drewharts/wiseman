## Elevator Pitch
Music is an extension of our personality. What we listen to, how much we listen to, and how we listen to "gives" who we are. Our conduits of music have become fashion statements and our ability to find new music have become personality statements. Unfortantely, not all the greatest music is easily accessible. One of my favorite songs ever has never been released. Finding this music can be hard. That's why we've created a medium that will pull your favorite artists from Spotify and search the web for music that isn't on Spotify or Apple Music. We hope to find unreleased or live session songs that will surpise you and make you love that artist even more.
